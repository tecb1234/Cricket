Let's do some analysis on batting statistics.

First lets run the code that processes all the raw files from Cricsheet:

```{r, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
source("process_cricsheet.R")
```

Let's calculate runs, balls faced and strike rate.
```{r}
batter_balls_faced <- ball_by_ball_df %>%
  group_by(batsman, match_id, ball, over) %>%
  tally() %>%
  group_by(batsman) %>%
  summarise(balls_faced = n())

batter_summary <- ball_by_ball_df %>%
  group_by(batsman) %>%
  summarise(runs = sum(`runs-batsman`)) %>%
  left_join(batter_balls_faced) %>%
  mutate(strike_rate = runs / balls_faced)
```

I need to work out a more elegant way to calculate the balls faced by each batsman, but this does appear to work.

Ok, now some plots


```{r}
ggplot(batter_summary, aes(x = balls_faced, y = runs)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, colour = "Blue") 
```

```{r}
ggplot(batter_summary, aes(x = strike_rate, y = runs)) + 
  geom_point() 
```
