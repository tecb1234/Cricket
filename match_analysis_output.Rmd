This is my first experiment with uing R Markdown.

First lets run the code that processes all the raw files from Cricsheet:

```{r, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
source("process_cricsheet.R")
```

Then lets do some calculations to work out the win, losses, no results and ties for each team:

```{r}
team_summary <- matches_df %>%
    group_by(teams) %>%
    summarise(games = length(teams),
              wins = sum(outcome.winner==teams, na.rm = TRUE),
              losses = sum(outcome.winner!= teams, na.rm = TRUE) - sum(is.na(outcome.winner), na.rm = TRUE),
              no_result = sum(result == "no result", na.rm = TRUE),
              tie = sum(outcome.result == "tie", na.rm= TRUE))

team_summary
```

And maybe a plot:

```{r}

ggplot(team_summary, aes(x = teams, y = wins)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```
